    "faq_1_question": "What happens if I stop payments along the way?",
    "faq_1_answer": "If you stop regular payments, only the capital already accumulated will continue to generate compound interest. The future value will therefore be lower than with regular payments until the end.",
    "faq_2_question": "What is the difference between compound and simple interest?",
    "faq_2_answer": "Simple interest only applies to the initial capital, whereas compound interest applies to the capital plus already generated interest. Compound interest therefore grows savings much faster in the long term."

    "faq_0_answer": "Our mortgage simulator calculates your monthly payment based on the amount borrowed, duration and interest rate. It lets you easily and freely estimate the monthly repayment of your mortgage.",
    "faq_1_question": "0% rate?",
    "faq_1_answer": "If the interest rate is 0%, the monthly payment is simply the amount borrowed divided by the number of payments. No interest is added.",
    "faq_2_question": "Include insurance?",
    "faq_2_answer": "This simulator does not take borrower insurance into account. For a more accurate estimate, consider adding the insurance cost to the calculated monthly payment.",
    "faq_3_question": "Does the monthly payment change if my mortgage rate increases?",
    "faq_3_answer": "Yes, if your mortgage has a variable rate, the monthly payment changes with the market. With a fixed-rate mortgage, the monthly payment calculation remains the same throughout the loan.",
    "faq_4_question": "Why use a monthly payment simulator for a mortgage?",
    "faq_4_answer": "Simulating your mortgage monthly payments helps you plan your budget, compare several loan offers and estimate the total cost of your mortgage before signing.",
    "faq_5_question": "How to reduce my mortgage monthly payments?",
    "faq_5_answer": "To reduce your mortgage monthly payment, you can extend the loan duration or negotiate a lower interest rate. Warning: extending the duration increases the total cost of the mortgage.",
    "faq_6_question": "What is the difference between a mortgage monthly payment and the total cost of the loan?",
    "faq_6_answer": "The monthly payment is the amount you repay each month for your mortgage. The total cost of the loan is the sum of all monthly payments and interest paid over the entire loan period."
