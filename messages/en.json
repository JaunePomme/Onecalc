  "faq_6_answer": "Costs should include all amounts invested: purchase price, acquisition fees, work, management fees, taxes, charges, etc. The more accurate the estimate, the more reliable the return calculation will be.",
  "faq_7_question": "Negative ROI?",
  "faq_7_answer": "A negative ROI means your investment has generated a loss: costs exceed gains. This can happen if income is insufficient or if the value of the asset decreases."
