    "faqTitle": "FAQ - Frequently asked questions about return calculation",
  "faq_0_question": "How to calculate the return on an investment?",
  "faq_0_answer": "The return on an investment is calculated by dividing the net gain generated by the initial amount invested, then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage. Our investment return simulator helps you easily estimate this rate.",
  "faq_1_question": "Why calculate the return on your investment?",
  "faq_1_answer": "Calculating the return on an investment allows you to measure the real profitability of your investment and compare different options such as stocks, real estate, or savings to optimize your gains.",
  "faq_2_question": "What is a good rate of return?",
  "faq_2_answer": "A good rate of return depends on the type of investment and the associated risk. For example, a return of 4 to 7% is often considered attractive for real estate, while stocks can offer higher but more volatile returns.",
  "faq_3_question": "Should taxes be included in the return calculation?",
  "faq_3_answer": "Yes, the net return on an investment should include any taxes and fees to reflect the real profitability of your investment. Our return calculator allows you to estimate this amount more precisely.",
  "faq_4_question": "What is the difference between return and capital gain?",
  "faq_4_answer": "Return refers to the regular income generated by an investment (dividends, rent), while capital gain is the profit made when selling the asset at a price higher than its purchase price.",
  "faq_5_question": "Difference between ROI/IRR?",
  "faq_5_answer": "ROI (Return On Investment) measures the total profitability of an investment over a given period, without taking duration into account. IRR (Internal Rate of Return) considers the timing of cash flows and allows you to compare investments of different durations.",
  "faq_6_question": "What should be included in costs?",
  "faq_6_answer": "Costs should include all amounts invested: purchase price, acquisition fees, work, management fees, taxes, charges, etc. The more accurate the estimate, the more reliable the return calculation will be.",
  "faq_7_question": "Negative ROI?",
  "faq_7_answer": "A negative ROI means your investment has generated a loss: costs exceed gains. This can happen if income is insufficient or if the value of the asset decreases."

    "faq_1_question": "Can I simulate several early repayments?",
    "faq_1_answer": "Yes, you can add several early repayments at different dates to see their impact on the loan duration and total cost.",
    "faq_2_question": "What is the impact of an early repayment?",
    "faq_2_answer": "An early repayment reduces the remaining principal: it can shorten the loan duration or reduce the monthly payment, depending on the chosen option."

    "faq_0_answer": "The 35% debt ratio is a common benchmark used by French banks to limit the risk of over-indebtedness. It corresponds to the maximum share of your net income that can be devoted to loan repayments. This threshold may vary depending on profiles and institutions.",
    "faq_1_question": "Should rent be included in monthly expenses?",
    "faq_1_answer": "Yes, if you are a tenant, rent must be included in monthly expenses. If you are buying your main residence and the loan will replace the rent, it can be excluded from the calculation.",
    "faq_2_question": "What is the impact of the loan term on borrowing capacity?",
    "faq_2_answer": "The longer the loan term, the higher the maximum monthly payment allows you to borrow. However, a longer term also increases the total cost of the loan due to interest.",
    "faq_3_question": "Is borrower insurance mandatory?",
    "faq_3_answer": "Borrower insurance is not legally mandatory, but it is systematically required by banks to cover risks of death, disability, or incapacity. Its cost must be included in the calculation of the maximum monthly payment.",
    "faq_4_question": "Can I borrow more if I have few expenses?",
    "faq_4_answer": "Yes, the fewer monthly expenses you have, the higher your borrowing capacity, as a greater share of your income can be devoted to loan repayment."
